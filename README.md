## Introduction

This repository is designed for beginners in data analysis and machine learning. It includes fundamental concepts and practical examples to help you get started with these topics in Python.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis section covers various techniques for exploring and visualizing data. It includes methods for cleaning, processing, and summarizing data to extract meaningful insights.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

### Clustering Algorithms

#### K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

#### Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters either by merging smaller clusters into larger ones or by splitting larger clusters into smaller ones.

### Classification Algorithms

#### Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the data.

#### Neural Network
Neural Networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering of raw input.

## Examples

The repository includes example notebooks and scripts demonstrating the use of each algorithm. These examples will guide you through the process of applying these methods to your own data.
